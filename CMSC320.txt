I am interested in taking CMSC 320 because I believe it will equip me with in-demand skills in data analysis, statistics, and machine learning, which are increasingly sought after in various industries. I also believe it is beneficial as it would equip me with skills to analyze and interpret data, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems as it combines programming, statistics, and domain knowledge, providing valuable expertise in a rapidly growing field with diverse applications across industries.
